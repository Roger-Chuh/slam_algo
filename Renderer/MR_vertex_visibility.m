function [visibility] = MR_vertex_visibility(Vxy,Vz,zbuffer,fbuffer,F)
%MR_VERTEX_VISIBILITY Compute per vertex visibility
%
% Inputs:
%    Vxy     - nverts x 2 matrix of 2D vertex projections
%    Vz      - nverts x 1 vector of vertex depths (i.e. z values in camera 
%              coordinate system)
%    zbuffer - h x w matrix of depths
%    fbuffer - h x w matrix of triangle indices from zbuffering
%    F       - nfaces x 3 matrix of vertex indices, i.e. mesh triangulation
%
% Outputs:
%    visibility - nverts x 1 vector of booleans indicating vertex
%                 visibility
